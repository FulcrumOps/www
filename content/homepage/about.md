Fulcrum Ops was founded in 2023 by [Pete Emerson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peteremerson/).

Pete has been automating infrastructure, monitoring, alerting and metrics collection 
since 2000. He has worked on bare metal, AWS, and GCP. Infrastructure as Code
software has included CFEngine, Puppet, Ansible, Rundeck, and Terraform. Monitoring and metrics
have included Cacti, Graphite, Prometheus, Nagios, Grafana, and numerous third party
software, including New Relic, Datadog, Sumo Logic, Splunk, and more. Alerting
has been done primarily with custom written software and Pager Duty.

Programming languages that Pete has used most recently include Go, Python, and Shell.
Other languages such as Perl, C, C++, and Java are back somewhere in the cobwebs of his brain.
